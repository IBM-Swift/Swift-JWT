# SwiftJWT
An implementation of [JSON Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) using Swift. JWTs offer a lightweight and compact format for transmitting information between parties, and the information can be verified and trusted due to JWTs being digitally signed.

For more information on JSON Web Tokens, their use cases and how they work, we recommend visiting [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/introduction/). 

**Reminder:** JWTs sent as JWS do **not** encrypt data, so never send anything sensitive or confidential in a JWT. This library does not currently support JWE.

## Swift version
The latest version of Swift-JWT requires **Swift 4.0** or later. You can download this version of the Swift binaries by following this [link](https://swift.org/download/). Compatibility with other Swift versions is not guaranteed.

## Usage

#### Add dependencies
Add the `Swift-JWT` package to the dependencies within your applicationâ€™s `Package.swift` file. Substitute `"x.x.x"` with the latest `Swift-JWT` [release](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-Session/releases).
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-JWT.git", from: "x.x.x")
```
Add `SwiftJWT` to your target's dependencies:
```swift
.target(name: "example", dependencies: ["SwiftJWT"]),
```
#### Import package
```swift
import SwiftJWT
```

## Getting Started

### The JWT model

In its compact form, a JSON Web Tokens consist of three sections of Base64Url encoded JSON, separated by dots (.).  
These section are: Headers, Claims and the Signature.
Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

#### Header

The Header struct contains the fields of the JSON Web Token header as defined by [RFC7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4).   
The "typ" header will default to "JWT". The "alg" header will be set the the algorithm name when you sign the JWT.  
The other Header fields can be set when initializing the Header or by changing them directly on the Header object.

```swift
let myHeader = Header(kid: "KeyID1")
```

#### Claims

Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
The Claims are defined by creating a Swift type that conforms to the `Claims` protocol. The fields of of this type represent the information that will be shared using the JWT.  

A list of recommended claims is defined in [RFC7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1).

```swift
struct MyClaims: Claims {
    let iss: String
    let sub: String
    let exp: Date
    let admin: Bool
}
let myClaims = MyClaims(iss: "Kitura", sub: "John", exp: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: 3600), admin: true)
```

#### JWT

The JWT struct represents the `Header` and `Claims` of a JSON Web Token.  
You can initialize a JWT by decoding a JWT String, or by providing the JWT Header and Claims. 

```swift
let myJWT = JWT(header: myHeader, claims: myClaims)
```

### Signing and Verifying JSON web tokens

#### Creating the RSA public and private keys 

To sign and verify a JWT using an RSA algorithm, you must provide a public and private key. This could be the contents of a .key file generated via the following Terminal commands:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f privateKey.key
# Don't add a passphrase
$ openssl rsa in privateKey.key -pubout -outform PEM -out privateKey.key.pub
```

This will create a public and private key pair on your system, and the contents of the private key can be passed into a Swift variable using the following code:

```swift
let privateKeyPath = URL(fileURLWithPath: getAbsolutePath(relativePath: "/path/to/privateKey.key"))
let privateKey: Data = try Data(contentsOf: privateKeyPath, options: alwaysMapped)
let publicKeyPath = URL(fileURLWithPath: getAbsolutePath(relativePath: "/path/to/publicKey.key"))
let publicKey: Data = try Data(contentsOf: publicKeyPath, options: alwaysMapped)
```

#### Sign a JWT using a JWTSigner

The struct JWTSigner contains the algorithms that can be used to sign a JWT.

Initialize a JWTSigner using the static function corresponding to the desired RSA algorithm:

```swift
let jwtSigner = JWTSigner.rs256(privateKey: privateKey)
```
To generate a signed JWT string, call the `sign` function on your JWT instance, passing in a JWTSigner:

```swift
let signedJWT = myJWT.sign(using: jwtSigner)
```

The resulting `signedJWT` will be a `String` of the form:
```
<encoded header>.<encoded claims>.<signature>
```
**Note:** The sign function sets the alg (algorithm) field of the header.

#### Verify a JWT using JWTVerifier

The struct JWTVerifier contains the algorithms that can be used to verify a JWT.

Initialize a JWTVerifier using the static function corresponding to the desired RSA algorithm:

```swift
let jwtVerifier = JWTVerifier.rs256(publicKey: publicKey)
```
To verify a signed JWT string, call the `sign` function on your JWT instance, passing in a JWTSigner:

```swift
let verified = JWT<MyClaims>.verify(signedJWT, using: jwtVerifier)
```
The `verified` field will be a `bool` that is true if the signiture is verified.


#### Supported Algorithms

The supported algorithms for signing and verifying JWTs are:

* RS256 - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256
* RS384 - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384
* RS512 - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512
* none - Don't sign or verify the JWT

### Validate claims

The `validateClaims` function validates the Standard Date claims of a JWT instance.
The following claims are validated if they are present in the `Claims` object:
- exp (expiration date)
- nbf (not before date)
- iat (issued at date)

The method returns `ValidateClaimsResult` - an enum that list the various reasons for validation failure.
If the validation succeeds `ValidateClaimsResult.success` is returned.

```swift
let validationResult = validateClaims()
if validationResult != .success {
    print("Claims validation failed: ", validationResult)
}
```

### Decode a JWT from a JWT string

A JWT struct can be initialized from a JWT string.  
The initializer will validate the claims and verify the signiture using the provide JWTVerifier before initializing the JWT.

```swift
let newJWT = JWT<MyClaims>(jwtString: signedJWT, jwtVerifier: jwtVerifier)
```

## MicroProfile Support

This library supports MicroProfile by allowing the creation of JWTs with specific claims needed by MicroProfile. These claims are found [here](http://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth/spec/src/main/asciidoc/interoperability.asciidoc). For full compliance, ensure your application saves the JWT with the name `MP-JWT` and uses `rs256` for token signing.
